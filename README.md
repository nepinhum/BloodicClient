## Installation
Bloodic can be installed like any other ‘Fabric’ mod:
1. Download and run the Fabric installer.
2. Add the Bloodic Client and Fabric API to your mods folder.

## Features
* Easy installation.
* Hack & client configuration.
* Many commonly known features. **More will be added.**

## Todo List
- [x] ClickGui
- [x] Settings for hack
- [x] Multi-language support
- [ ] And after clarifying some things; my main goal after 2.0.0-beta is to create anti-methods that can resist servers.
