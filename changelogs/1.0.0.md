## Changelog: v1.0.0
**NOTE**: Well.. I have to admit that I don't clearly remember how I jumped from an early version like 0.0.2 to 1.0.0. Most likely I created a wrong tag and version name or... Eh I don't know but the only thing I know for sure is that this and subsequent versions will definitely not be referred to as “1.x.”

- Updated to version 1.20.1. (FABRIC Loader=0.17.3)
- AutoSprint & Flight updates
- It has been updated according to API changes affecting the previous version(s).
